# Puzzle-O
The Puzzle interface is implemented by the three puzzles and contains a set of methods to check the row and column constraints. Thereâ€™s also a set of methods (checkAnswer and checkFinalAnswer) which are a different set of constraints called when the user presses the Check Answer button as they continue filling the puzzle. Puzzle also contains a method to get the grid, get possible values and get the game frame.

-The Spot class extends JButton and all the in-puzzle buttons for each puzzle extend this class.

-The Cell classes are the puzzle buttons that extend Spot.

-The CheckAnswerButton, ShowSolutionButton and ExitButton classes extend JButton and set up the corresponding function buttons. Each has a listener class separately.

-The OptionButton class set up the buttons in the main menu in which one chooses a puzzle. The classes StartHitoriListener, StartKakurasuListener and StartFuwariListener implement action listener and are added to the OptionButton when necessary.

-The Hitori, Kakurasu and Fuwari BackgroundPanel and StartPanel classes are for setting up the background graphics on the respective panels.

-The MainFrame class sets up the main menu where the user initially chooses between the puzzles.
